### **2. Clone This Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/telegram-file-bot.git
cd telegram-file-bot
```

### **3. Set Environment Variables**
You need to configure the following environment variables:

| Variable         | Description                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `ENV_BOT_TOKEN`   | Your Telegram bot token.            |
| `ENV_BOT_SECRET`  | A unique secret token for security. |

#### **For Cloudflare Workers**
Set these variables via the Cloudflare dashboard or CLI:

**Using Dashboard:**
1. Go to the **Workers** page in the Cloudflare dashboard.
2. Click on your worker and go to **Settings > Variables**.
3. Add `ENV_BOT_TOKEN` and `ENV_BOT_SECRET`.

**Using Wrangler CLI:**
```bash
wrangler secret put ENV_BOT_TOKEN
wrangler secret put ENV_BOT_SECRET
```

---

### **4. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers**
1. Install the Wrangler CLI if not already installed:
   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   ```
2. Publish the worker:
   ```bash
   wrangler publish
   ```

---

### **5. Register the Webhook**
After deploying the worker, set the webhook for your Telegram bot:

1. Replace `<YOUR_WORKER_URL>` with your Cloudflare Worker URL (e.g., `https://your-bot-name.workers.dev`).
2. Run this command:
   ```bash
   curl -F "url=<YOUR_WORKER_URL>/endpoint" \
        -F "secret_token=your-secret-token" \
        https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook
   ```

## **How It Works**
1. Users send a URL to the bot on Telegram.
2. The bot:
   - Downloads the file from the provided URL.
   - Determines its type using the MIME type and file extension.
   - Uploads it in the correct format using the Telegram Bot API.

---

## **Error Handling**
- If the file size exceeds 50 MB, the bot responds with:  
  `The file is too large to send (maximum: 50 MB).`
- If the URL is invalid or the download fails, the bot responds with:  
  `Please send a valid URL to download the file.`
- If Telegram API encounters an issue, the bot provides an error message.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- âœ… Support for ZIP or RAR archives with automatic extraction.
- âœ… Support for text and markdown messages for additional context.
- âœ… Progress indicators for large file downloads.
